# Wireless_LED_Controller

<h2> Attributions </h2>
Many thanks to [Robert](https://forum.core-electronics.com.au/u/robert93820) from the Core Electronics forum, he has been a huge help to both myself and the community

Progress was tracked on the [Core Electronics Maker Forum](https://forum.core-electronics.com.au/t/12-day-project-esp32-led-controller/12926)

I'll eventually circle back to this project in a more wholistic sense so that its super simple to use.

If you have any questions send them through!
